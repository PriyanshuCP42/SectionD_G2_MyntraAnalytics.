## Business Problem

Myntra, India's leading online fashion and lifestyle retailer, operates in a fiercely competitive e-commerce landscape where pricing strategy, brand positioning, and discount depth directly determine revenue and customer retention. The category management and merchandising teams struggle to identify which product categories, brands, and gender segments drive the most value — and whether current discount structures are eroding margin without meaningfully improving volume. This project serves the Head of Category Management and the Pricing Strategy team as primary decision-makers.

**Core Business Question**

> Which product categories, brands, and customer segments on Myntra offer the highest revenue potential, and how should discount and pricing strategies be optimised to maximise both sales volume and profitability?

**Decision Supported**

> This analysis will enable the Category Management team to prioritise high-performing brands and categories for promotional spend, restructure discount tiers for underperforming segments, and align inventory investments with actual customer demand — directly improving gross margin and reducing unsold stock.

## Dataset

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Source Name** | Kaggle — Raw Dataset (manishmathias/myntra-fashion-dataset) |
| **Direct Access Link** | [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishmathias/myntra-fashion-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishmathias/myntra-fashion-dataset/data) |
| **Row Count** | ~1,00,000+ product listings (verify after download) |
| **Column Count** | 10+ meaningful analytical columns |
| **Time Period Covered** | December 2021 — January 2023 |
| **Format** | CSV |

**Key Columns Used**

| Column Name | Description | Role in Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| `ProductBrand` | Brand name of the fashion product | Brand-level segmentation and revenue grouping |
| `Price (MRP)` | Maximum retail price before discount | Baseline for pricing analysis and margin calculation |
| `DiscountPrice` | Final selling price after discount applied | Used to compute Discount % and Effective Revenue |
| `DiscountOffer` | Discount label / percentage offered | KPI computation for Average Discount Rate |
| `Ratings` | Customer rating score (out of 5) | Quality segmentation and customer satisfaction KPI |
| `Reviews` | Number of customer reviews | Proxy for sales volume and demand signal |
| `Category` | Top-level product category (e.g., Topwear, Footwear) | Category-level aggregation and drill-down filtering |
| `Gender` | Target customer gender (Men / Women / Kids) | Segment-level performance comparison |
| `PrimaryColor` | Dominant product colour | Trend analysis and visual merchandising insight |
| `Description` | Product description text | NLP-based feature tagging (optional enrichment) |

For full column definitions, see [`docs/data_dictionary.md`](docs/data_dictionary.md).

## KPI Framework

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
|---|---|---|
| **Average Discount Rate (%)** | Measures how aggressively products are discounted on average across categories | `((MRP − DiscountPrice) / MRP) × 100` — computed per category in `04_statistical_analysis.ipynb` |
| **Effective Revenue Index** | Proxy revenue score combining sell-through price with review volume as a demand signal | `DiscountPrice × log(1 + Reviews)` — computed per brand in `05_final_load_prep.ipynb` |
| **Rating-to-Discount Correlation** | Measures whether heavier discounts correlate with better or worse customer ratings | Pearson correlation between `Discount %` and `Ratings` in `04_statistical_analysis.ipynb` |
| **Category Value Score** | Ranks categories by their balance of high price, high rating, and high review count | Composite normalised score: `0.4×Price + 0.3×Rating + 0.3×log(Reviews)` in `05_final_load_prep.ipynb` |
| **Brand Concentration Index** | Share of total listings held by the top 10 brands — measures market concentration | `(Top 10 Brand Listings / Total Listings) × 100` in `03_eda.ipynb` |

Document KPI logic clearly in `notebooks/04_statistical_analysis.ipynb` and `notebooks/05_final_load_prep.ipynb`.

## Key Insights

_To be populated after full analysis. Template entries shown below as placeholders — replace with data-backed findings from your notebooks._

1. **Discount depth does not drive ratings** — A weak or negative correlation between discount percentage and customer ratings suggests that price cuts alone do not improve perceived product quality or customer satisfaction.
2. **Topwear dominates listing volume but Footwear commands higher average price points** — indicating a cross-category opportunity to push premium Footwear listings harder.
3. **Women's fashion accounts for the majority of listings yet shows higher average discount rates** — pointing to potential margin erosion that requires category-level pricing review.
4. **Top 10 brands account for a disproportionate share of all listings** — reflecting high market concentration; long-tail brands need visibility support or should be rationalised.
5. **Products priced in the ₹500–₹1,500 mid-range receive the highest volume of reviews** — suggesting this price band captures the largest active buyer cohort.
6. **Heavily discounted products (>50% off) receive fewer reviews on average** — implying that deep discounts may signal low-quality perception rather than driving purchases.
7. **Kids' fashion is the smallest segment by listing count but carries above-average MRP** — an underserved, high-margin segment worth targeted expansion.
8. **Certain brand–category combinations consistently achieve ratings above 4.0 with minimal discounting** — identifying brand-category pairs that can sustain premium pricing.
9. _Insight 9 — to be filled after EDA_
10. _Insight 10 — to be filled after statistical analysis_

## Recommendations

| # | Insight | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Discount depth does not improve ratings | Cap discount offers at 30–35% for categories where ratings are already high; redirect discount budget to loyalty rewards instead | Estimated 5–8% improvement in gross margin on top-rated SKUs |
| 2 | Women's segment shows high discount rates with average ratings | Conduct a SKU rationalisation for low-rated, high-discount women's products; reduce listing clutter and focus on proven brands | Reduce markdown losses by an estimated 10–15% in the Women's segment |
| 3 | Mid-range ₹500–₹1,500 segment drives highest engagement | Prioritise this price band for new brand onboarding and seasonal campaign targeting | Estimated 12–18% uplift in review volume, improving social proof for conversion |
| 4 | Kids' fashion is high-margin and underserved | Increase Kids' category SKU count by sourcing 2–3 premium brand partnerships; run targeted back-to-school and festive campaigns | Expand Kids' category GMV by an estimated 20% within one season |
| 5 | Top brand concentration creates platform dependency risk | Develop a Myntra Emerging Brands programme to uplift mid-tier brands with curated visibility — reducing top-10 brand dependency | Improve platform resilience and diversify revenue across 30+ brands |

## Analytical Pipeline

The project follows a structured 7-step workflow:

1. **Define** — Sector selected (E-Commerce / Fashion Retail), problem statement scoped around Myntra pricing and category strategy, mentor approval obtained at Gate 1.
2. **Extract** — Raw Myntra dataset sourced from Kaggle and committed to `data/raw/`; data dictionary drafted in `docs/data_dictionary.md`.
3. **Clean and Transform** — Cleaning pipeline built in `notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb`: handle missing values in `Ratings` and `Reviews`, parse `DiscountOffer` string into numeric discount percentage, standardise `Gender` and `Category` labels, remove duplicate product entries.
4. **Analyze** — EDA in notebook `03` (brand concentration, price distributions, rating patterns); Statistical analysis in notebook `04` (Pearson correlation between discount and rating, OLS regression of price on reviews, segment hypothesis testing).
5. **Visualize** — Interactive Tableau dashboard built with Executive KPI view and Operational drill-down; published on Tableau Public.
6. **Recommend** — 5 data-backed business recommendations delivered, each tied to a specific KPI finding.
7. **Report** — Final project report and presentation deck completed and exported to PDF in `reports/`.
